      <h2 class="card-main" id="daniel-main">I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current,
        if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth. </h2>

      <p class="card-text" id="daniel-text">“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been
        looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the
        free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best -
        and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as
        a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

      <p class="card-text" id="jhonathan-text">“ I started as a total newbie with virtually no coding skills. I now work
        as a mobile engineer for a big company. This was one of the best investments I’ve made in myself. ” </p>

        guidance from them and
        learning from their experiences was easy. </h2>

      <p class="card-text" id="patrick-text">“ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really
        refreshing. The program
        gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable
        junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from
        an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ” </p>

      <h2 class="card-main" id="kira-main">Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended! </h2>

      <p class="card-text" id="kira-text">“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed
        some structure from
        professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
        student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff
        did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
        project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial
        could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent
        experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.
        100% recommend! ” </p>
